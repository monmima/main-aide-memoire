# Lingtrain Alignment Studio

To install Lingtrain Alignment Studio, go to the [Lingtrain Alignment Studio Github page](https://github.com/averkij/a-studio). You'll have to install Docker on your system. If Docker gives you error message, try to place <code>sudo</code> before every command and that should do the trick.
