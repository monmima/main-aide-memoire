## Reading text using different voices

Assuming you have a voice called ***Microsoft Mary** on your computer, this is how you can tell Balaboka to read text with a different voice than the rest of the text.

    <voice required="Name=Microsoft Mary">This is the English text.</voice>

You can select any other language available in the drop-down menu.
