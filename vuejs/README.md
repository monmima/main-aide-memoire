# vuejs-aide-memoire

An aide-m√©moire (aid to the memory) for people learning the VueJS framework. This is a CDN-based project, because CDN is more user friendly if you just want to test out stuff with VueJS without doing the full-blown NPM installation.

## Installing VueJS

Run this command to install Vue CLI:

    sudo npm -g i @vue/cli

Run this command to create the project folder:

    vue create project-name

Select **Default (Vue 3)** and press Enter.

Run this command to run the project:

    npm run serve
