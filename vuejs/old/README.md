## Installing VueJS CLI

Run this command to install Vue CLI:

    sudo npm -g i @vue/cli

## Upgrading NodeJS/NPM

If you have not update NodeJS/NPM, you will probably need to do this. Based on a [tutorial by Steve Griffith](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9gehlXhS6U).

1. Clear out the cache

        npm cache clean -f

1. Install N

        sudo npm install -g n

1. Run N

        sudo n stable

1. Before checking for the version of NPM, close you Terminal window and reopen it. This way, you will be sure the version number was updated.
        
You could also replace **stable** with **latest** or with a specific version number such a **7.1.2**.

## Creating a VueJS project

The easiest way to add Vuex in a project is to install it from the get-go:

1. Open a Terminal window.
1. Type this:

        vue create [my-name]

1. You can also type this if you're already in the project folder:

        vue create .

1. Select **Manually select features**.
1. Use the spacebar to enable features such as Vuex and Vue-router. I recommend:

    - Babel
    - Router
    - Vuex
    - CSS Pre-processors
    - **Uncheck** Linter / Formatter

1. Select 3.x for the version you use.
1. Answer **Y** to **Use history mode for router?**.
1. **At the end of the process, you'll be asked to save your options as a preset. If you didn't get to choose any of the options above, maybe that's because you have set a preset already.** 

## Running a project

Run this command to run a project:

    npm run serve
