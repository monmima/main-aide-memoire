# Forms: GET versus POST

With the GET method, you send data through the URL. This is very insecure because you are sending data right in the URL.

The POST request is safer because you use the HTTP header instead. It's even better with HTTPS to really secure that data.

Since the POST method is being used here nothing shows up in the adress bar above. Passwords should always be handled with the POST method.
