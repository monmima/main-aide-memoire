# Classes and methods

Usually you use "public" and "private" instead of "var" in a class.

Usually you use "public" (can be accessed anywhere outside of the class), "protected" (only in class or class that extends the one you created) and "private" (only this class) instead of "var" in a class.

    <?php
        class Student {
            
            public $name;
            public $major;
            public $gpa;

            function __construct($name, $major, $gpa) {
                $this->name = $name;
                $this->major = $major;
                $this->gpa = $gpa;
            }

            function hasHonors() {
                // Whenever you return true or false values, PHP is not going to be able to print out "true" or "false" so you have to print these out as strings.
                if ($this->gpa >= 3.5) {
                    return "true";
                } else {
                    return "false";
                }
            }
        }

        $student1 = new Student("Jim", "Business", 2.8);
        $student2 = new Student("Pam", "Art", 3.6);

        echo $student1->hasHonors() . "<br>";
        echo $student2->hasHonors() . "<br>";
    ?>
