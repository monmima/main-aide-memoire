The public folder of a Laravel project is what you use if you don't have a build process.
If you do have a build process and are using gulp.js or webpack, you use the resources folder.

Laravel comes with webpack support out of the box.
See the file webpack.mix.js for more information.
You can see your dependencies in the package.json file.
You can install dependencies through npm install.

To compile your code, use "npm run dev" or "npm run watch" to compile your code on the fly.`
