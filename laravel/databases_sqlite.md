# Using SQLite locally on Linux Mint

Thanks to [Coder's Tape
](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWmnQvznkUI) for creating his tutorial on YouTube on how to change the default SQL database settings to SQLite.

1. Go to the .env file.
1. Find this:

		DB_CONNECTION=mysql
		DB_HOST=127.0.0.1
		DB_PORT=3306
		DB_DATABASE=todo
		DB_USERNAME=root
		DB_PASSWORD=

1. Replace the above with this:

		DB_CONNECTION=sqlite

1. Create a database through the Terminal or manually. **Use the .sqlite extension instead of .db or Laravel will tell you the file does not exists since it will look for a .sqlite extension.**

        touch database/database.sqlite

1. Install possibly missing dependencies

        composer require doctrine/dbal

1. Add this line to the require block in your composer.json file:

        "ext-pdo_sqlite": "*"

1. Run this command:

        composer update


1. **Watch out!**  At this point you might get this error message:

	> Root composer.json requires PHP extension ext-pdo_sqlite * but it is missing from your system. Install or enable PHP's pdo_sqlite extension.

1. If that's the case, try to run this command:

		sudo apt-get install php-sqlite3

1. Open a Terminal window **from within VS Code** and type the following command. **If you use an independant Terminal window, you will get an error message.** You should be in the root folder when typing this.

        php artisan migrate

1. If everything went fine, the Terminal window should make it pretty clear that new tables have been created in your database.
