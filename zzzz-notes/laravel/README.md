# Laravel Aide-Mémoire

___

## A Word of Thanks

I am indebted to many people for being able to create this aide-mémoire. I had to figure out a way to do many different things, including:

- Installing Laravel on Linux Mint
- Using SQLite
- Deploying a Laravel project to Heroku

On top of that, I had to wrap my head around the ways of Laravel, and this was made possible thanks to [Jeffrey Way from Laracast](https://laracasts.com/series/laravel-8-from-scratch). His tutorial is crisp, comes with all the code in a Github repository and is explained is plain terms. And on top of that, it's free.

## Installing Laravel on Linux Mint

Thanks to Ceed Media for his [YouTube tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cVecpIbonnU) on how to install Laravel on Linx Mint. The steps he follows are below.

1. Update your system

        sudo apt-get update

2. Install curl

        sudo apt install curl

3. Install PHP

        sudo apt install php

4. Install Composer

        curl -s https://getcomposer.org/installer | php

5. Move the file

        sudo mv composer.phar /usr/local/bin/composer

6. Confirm Composer is installed

        composer

7. Install Laravel

        composer global require laravel/installer

8. Edit .bashrc

        nano .bashrc

9. Under "esac", type:

        export PATH="$PATH:$HOME/.config/composer/vendor/bin"

10. Use CTRL + X to save
11. Press Enter to confirm the name of the file

12. Refresh the file:

        source ~/.bashrc

13. Install Laravel

        laravel (to install laravel)

14. Go to the Desktop folder

        cd Desktop

15. Install php-mbstring

        sudo apt-get install php-mbstring

16. Install php-xml

        sudo apt-get install php-xml

17. Download the lastest dependencies

        composer update

18. Use CTRL + H in the project folder
19. Rename **.env.example** to **.env** (there might already be a file with this name and therefore this step might be useless)

### The Net Ninja Way

The Net Ninja installs Laravel globally in [one of his tutorials](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E74_WZpjeKA) with **composer global require laravel/installer**. This means that you can create Laravel projects wherever you want.

___

### Creating a Project and Running it

    laravel new [my-web-app-name]
    php artisan key:generate
    php artisan serve

Now go to your browser and type http://localhost:8000/ in the address bar.

___

## Deleting Your Dependencies To Move A Project Around

All dependencies are stored in your **vendor** and **node_module** subfolders. To reinstall your dependencies, for instance after downloading your project from a git repository, use **composer update** and **npm install**.

___

## Using An Existing Laravel Project On Another Machine

If you have formatted your computer or are using another computer and want to use a pre-existing project, you'll have to go through the following steps:

1. Install NPM:

        sudo apt install npm

2. Install Composer:

        sudo apt install Composer

3. Install the SQLite module for PHP:

        sudo apt-get install php-sqlite3

4. Install whatever this is:

        sudo apt-get install php-xml

5. Install the composer dependencies:

        composer install

6. Install the NPM dependencies:

        npm install

## Using And Running MySQL On Linux Mint

Obviously, you can use Microsoft, Linux or the Macintosh operating system to run this project, but I'm keeping these steps below just in case I get stuck again, and I use Linux Mint as my main OS.

1. Download XAMPP for Linux from https://www.apachefriends.org/download.html
2. Run the .run file as a root user
3. To run XAMPP, go to /opt/lampp/ as a root user
4. Go to localhost/dashboard/ or go to localhost/phpmyadmin
5. Double-click on manager-linux-x64.run
6. Create a database and then import the content into it if needs be (you cannot create a database directly from a file you want to import)
7. Go to the .env file and make sure your environment variables look like this:

        DB_CONNECTION=mysql
        DB_HOST=127.0.0.1
        DB_PORT=3306
        DB_DATABASE=name_of_my_database
        DB_USERNAME=root
        DB_PASSWORD=

8. Go to root folder, open a Terminal window and type:

        php artisan migrate

9. If everything went fine, your database should now have a few tables that were automatically created such as failed_jobs, etc.

Notes:

- Apparently, the path can be a bit different from one Linux distro to the other.
- If your Apache server won't start (red dot next to it in XAMPP), run this command:

        sudo systemctl stop apache2

- If the above really won't work, I suggest restarting your computer, and then running the same command.

## Using SQLite locally on Linux Mint

https://www.codementor.io/@goodnesskay/developing-locally-using-sqlite-with-laravel-on-ubuntu-8s8358503

Thanks to [Coder's Tape
](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWmnQvznkUI) for creating his tutorial on YouTube on how to change the default SQL database settings to SQLite.

1. Go to the .env file
2. Replace **DB_CONNECTION=mysql** with **DB_CONNECTION=sqlite**
3. Erase all the other database-related lines (all lines starting with the prefix "DB_") such as DB_HOST=127.0.0.1, DB_PASSWORD=, etc.
4. Create a database through the Terminal or manually

        touch database/database.sqlite

5. Update Composer

        composer update

6. Install possibly missing dependencies

        composer require doctrine/dbal

7. Go to the .env file and make sure your environment variables look like this:

        DB_CONNECTION=sqlite

8. Go to the root folder, open a Terminal window and type:

        php artisan migrate

9. If everything went fine, your database should nonw have a few tables that were automatically created such as failed_jobs, etc.

## Heroku

My references here were a [tutorial on YouTube by Jonny Kalambay](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MxfxiR8TVNU) and an answer on the [Trailblazer Community](https://trailblazers.salesforce.com/answers?id=9064S000000DHq1QAG).

Also, for the details that pertain to Laravel in particular, [codigofacilito and his tutorial on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE2Kmy8WL3g) were very useful to me. By the way his tutorial is in Spanish. He also explains how to upload a PostgreSQL database to the project at the end of his video.

### Installing the CLI

1. Install snap ([documentation available on snapcraft](https://snapcraft.io/docs/installing-snap-on-linux-mint))

        sudo rm /etc/apt/preferences.d/nosnap.pref
        sudo apt update
        sudo apt install snapd

2. Install Heroku

        snap install --classic heroku

### Creating a Heroku Project

1. Go to Heroku
    - https://dashboard.heroku.com/apps
2. Create a new project such as [my-web-app-name]
3. Go to the Terminal Window and make sure the app/project is initialized as a Git repository by typing:

        git status

4. On the Heroku web site, you can find more information about the name of your project under the **deploy** tab.
5. Create a file named **Procfile** (no extension) at the root of your project. It should contain this:
    - web: vendor/bin/heroku-php-apache2 public/
6. Go to the .env file. You'll need to copy and paste a series of lines to the Terminal window.

        heroku git:remote -a [my-web-app-name]

        heroku config:add APP_NAME=Laravel

        heroku config:add APP_ENV=production

        heroku config:add APP_KEY=...

        heroku config:add APP_DEBUG=true

        heroku config:add APP_URL=http://[my-web-app-name].test

7. Push your project to Heroku:

        git push heroku HEAD:master

8. On the Heroku's web site, click on **Open app**, which should be located somewhere in the top right corner of the page of your project
9. Now you should see your app.
11. See below if you want to use SQLite as a database in Heroku.

### Updating Your Project

Now all you have to do is to update your remote project and type:
    
    git push heroku HEAD:master

### Using SQLite in Heroku

Your app might run perfectly locally. Setting it up so it runs remotely as well is slightly more complicated.

The first thing you have to keep in mind if you use a combination of SQLite and Heroku, you will overwrite your remote database with each redeployment, thus resetting it to what you have locally.

For more information on using Heroku and SQLite, please visit [David Tang's Deploying Laravel with SQLite to Heroku article](https://davidtang.io/deploying-laravel-with-sqlite-to-heroku/). 

Here are the steps you have to follow:

1. Make sure you are on the right branch and the features you want are on the main branch too.
2. Delete .sqlite reference from the .gitignore file located within the /database folder.
3. Add **"ext-pdo_sqlite": "*"** to the **require** block in **composer.json**
4. Open a Terminal window
5. Run this:

        composer update

6. Type these lines one by one to set your environment variables:

        heroku config:add APP_NAME=Laravel
        heroku config:add APP_ENV=production
        heroku config:add APP_DEBUG=true
        heroku config:add DB_CONNECTION=sqlite
        heroku config:add

7. Type these lines one by one as well, correcting them with the correct information:

        heroku config:add APP_URL=https://app-name.com/
        heroku config:add APP_KEY=...

8. Finally, I used to type **heroku config:add DB_DATABASE=database** in the Terminal, but this created a bug. This is probably a **step to avoid**. It apparently created the bug where I would get a message about **PRAGMA**, **foreign keys**, and the online app **not connecting to the database** properly.

## Downloading A Laravel Project From Github And Setting It Up

This information was found on [stackoverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/48116952/ddg#48117041).

- Do this:

        composer install

- Rename .env.example as .env and update it with your database credentials (**DB_CONNECTION=sqlite**
and **DB_HOST=127.0.0.1** for this project).

- Then do this:


        php artisan key:generate

        php artisan serve

## Tables, Migrations And Models

### Creating A New Table, Migration, Model And So Forth

To generate multiples files in a single command, use:

        php artisan make:model ModelName -mc

Note: In **-mc**, **m** stands for ***migration*** and **c** stands for ***controller***. You can also add **api** to the end of the string if you want to use AJAX.

This will create the:

- Migration
- Project model
- Controller

### Redoing A Migration

If you want to drop previously-created columns in your database and recreate them, use this command:

        php artisan migrate:fresh

## Creating A Controller By Itself

As a rule of thumb, you should have one controller per table in your database.

        php artisan make:controller AweSomeController

## Solving Different Bugs

### Error Class 'App\Http\Controllers\Karaoke' not found

- Add this at the beginning of your controller file:

        use App\Models\Karaoke;


### 500 - Server Error

- Your project is probably missing the .env file. For security reasons, the .env file is not typically uploaded to Git repositories.

### Target class [PizzaController] does not exist.

- Make sure you are using the right namespace. The namespace is not working the same way in older versions of Laravel. Go to your web.php file and change this:

        Route::get('/pizzas', 'PizzaController@index');

- To this:

        Route::get('/pizzas', 'App\Http\Controllers\PizzaController@index');

### Getting a token in the address bar instead of storing/updating the database

- Something is likely to be wrong with your form. This could be caused by:

    - The "method" attribute that your forgot for the &lt;form&gt; tag
    - Nesting a &lt;form&gt; tag inside of another form tag, etc.

### The PUT method is not supported for this route. Supported methods: GET, HEAD.

- Something is wrong with your route. The form route and the web.php route doesn't seem to be the same.

### SQLSTATE[23000]: Integrity constraint violation: 19 NOT NULL constraint failed: songs.name (SQL: update "songs" set "name" = ?, "artist" = ?, "lyrics" = ?, "link" = ?, "updated_at" = 2021-06-28 19:59:50 where "id" = 1)

- Something is wrong with the "name" and "id" attributes of your input fields. Are you sure they exist and they are named properly?
- Another possibility is that you're leaving a field empty and submitting the form when the database expects a non-null value. To solve this, to to your migrate file.

- And change this:

       $table->string('lyrics');

- To this:

       $table->string('lyrics')->nullable();

## Creating A Many-To-Many Relationship (Pivot Table)

Thanks to [Code with Daryl](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oFNu_RhTt4) for providing his tutorial on YouTube. Also, thanks to [Qirolab](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JQ01o10Mva4).

___

1. To create a new model and migration, type this in your terminal:

        php artisan make:model Category -m

2. Find the place in your new migration that looks like this:

        $table->id();
        $table->timestamps();

3. Insert a new line so it looks like this:

        $table->id();
        $table->string('title');
        $table->timestamps();

4. Go back to the terminal and force a new migration with this:

        php artisan migrate:fresh

5. Go to the category table in your database and create this categories manually. Don't forget to save your modifications.

6. Now is time to create a migration for the pivot table. Let's assume you have two table. One is called "song" and the other is called "category". Create a pivot table using this command **while respecting the alphabetical order** (***category*** comes before ***song***):

        php artisan make:migration create_category_song_table --create=category_song

7. Go to the newest migration file and find this:

        $table->id();
        $table->timestamps();

8. Insert a new line so it looks like this (**once again, assuming one of the tables is called categories and the other songs**):

        $table->id();
        $table->integer('category_id')->unsigned();
        $table->integer('song_id')->unsigned();
        $table->timestamps();

9. Migrate again using the following command:

        php artisan migrate:fresh

10. Now, go to the **Song** model (assuming that's its name) under app/Models.

11. Find something that looks like this:

        use HasFactory;

12. Change it to this:

        use HasFactory;

        public function categories()
        {
                return $this->belongsToMany(SongCategory::class);
        }

13. Now, go to the **Category** model (assuming that's its name) under app/Models.

14. Find something that looks like this:

        use HasFactory;

15. Change it to this:

        use HasFactory;

        public function songs()
        {
                return $this->belongsToMany(Song::class);
        }

16. Create a controller for your categories;

17. Add an index function that returns JSON to your CategoryController. This will confirm that everything is working just fine.

        /**
        * Display a listing of the resource.
        *
        * @return \Illuminate\Http\Response
        */
        public function index()
        {

                $categories = Category::all();

                return [
                "categories" => $categories,
                ];

        }

17. Create a route that returns a page with the content of the above index function.
