# Types: passing values

Passing by value is what happens when you create a primitive from another primitive. **A primitive is a variable which is not an object or an array.**

Passing by reference is what happens when you create a non-primitive from another non-primtive.

To avoid problems with this, you must create a new non-primtive.
