# Types in TypeScript

Even if you don't explicitely set a variable, TypeScript does type inference to a certain extent.

## Number

	let id: number = 5;

## String

	let company: string = "Traversy Media";

## Boolean

	let isPublished: boolean

## Any

This is a a special TS type that allows any of the JS types.

	let x: any = true;
