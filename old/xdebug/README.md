# Xdebug

## Bugs

If you get some strange message in the Terminal when you try to start Xdebug, it might be because you are now clicking on the right debug button.

1. Click on the debug button in the left panel with icons, not in the top right corner of VS Code.
2. After clicking on the right button, a new green arrow will appear near the top left corner of VS Code. This is where you have to click.
