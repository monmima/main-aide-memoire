# TTS - ResponsiveVoice API

Now you need an API key to connect to Responsive Voice. That was not the case until recently. The API key is free.

Once you have installed ResponsiveVoice in a project, here is how you send a query:

        // responsiveVoice.speak(text, "French Female");
        // responsiveVoice.speak(text, "Italian Female");
        responsiveVoice.speak(text, "US English Female");

There is [documentation on how to use ResponsiveVoice with callbacks](https://responsivevoice.org/text-to-speech-sdk/using-callbacks/).
