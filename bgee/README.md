## Removing the XP cap

<blockquote>Hi!

I took the files @mlnevese organized and made a safer XP Cap.

See in BGEE/SoD/BP, if you reach 3.000.000 XP you'll be locked in the level up screen because BGEE has no info about HLAs and the game will demand that you select HLAs.

This happened to me once in Avernus during a (very) power playing run and often happens to me when testing my mods (as I need to keep leveling up to test things).

That being said, the attached file contains an XP Cap Enhancer - you'll be able to safely go all the way to 2.999.999 XP!

Cheers!

Edit: @mlnevese if you want to add those to the first page of the thread, I would be very happy.
