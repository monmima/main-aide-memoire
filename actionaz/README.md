# Actiona/Actionaz Aide-MÃ©moire (cheat sheet) With A WooCommerce Script

This is a simple Actiona/Actionaz script. Don't ask me for the difference between Actiona and Actionaz. All I know is these two names float around on the Internet and are used synonymously.

This is basically copy-and-paste on steroids.

This script copies and pastes the content of LibreOffice Calc cells into fields of a WooCommerce product form. The fields in the WooCommerce form must be chosen manually and most operations must be carried out manually in the WooCommerce form itself.

This relative simplicity allows for more flexibility and reusability. To make all other copying and pasting related operations automatized would call for a much heavier and complex script which would need adaptation to every new task.

## Installing Actiona/Actionaz on Linux Mint

    sudo apt-get install actiona

To find out what version you are running (or whether or not Actiona/Actionaz is installed on your system), type:

    actiona --version

## What You Should Know

To work properly, this script needs:

- an open **Firefox tab**, with the Add new product form in it
- a **LibreOffice Calc** spreadsheet **produits.ods**, where:
    - the first column is empty
    - each row of the last column contains the string **zzzz** (this is how the script knows it has reached the end of the line)

Please refer to the included LibreOffice Calc spreadsheet as an example.

## How To Use This Script

Assuming all of the above is taken into account, you should:

1. Place your cursor where information needs to be pasted in the WooCommerce form.
2. Place your cursor at the very left of the row where you need to start in your spreadsheet (typically the upper left corner of your spreadsheet)
3. Start the script using the red cogwheel icon in the Actiona/Actionaz interface or, more conveniently, using the Actionaz hotkey (Tools ===> Settings ===> Start/Stop execution hotkey)

## Adapting This Script To Another Task

This script could easily be adapted to another similar task where you need to copy and paste data from a spreadsheet into a web browser form.

All you need to do is to make sure the names of your Firefox and spreadsheet windows in Actiona/Actionaz match whatever you have so the right window is set to the foreground at the right time.
